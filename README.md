# ish - A Simple Shell in Zig

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress!** ðŸš§

This is still under active development. Things might break, change, or not work at all.

An attempt at building a basic Unix shell in Zig. It's based on Stephen Brennan's ["Write a Shell in C"](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) tutorial, but using Zig's safety features and error handling.

## What it will do at some point

- Takes commands and runs them (like a very basic bash)
- Has a few built-in commands (cd, help, exit)

## Running it

```bash
zig build
./zig-out/bin/ish
```
